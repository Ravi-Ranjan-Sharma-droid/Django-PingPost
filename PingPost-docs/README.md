### PingPost Documentation

This directory contains the complete documentation set for the PingPost project. It is organized to serve different audiences: contributors, maintainers, deployers, and users.

- docs/design: System, API, database, and UI/UX design materials
- docs/requirements: Business, functional, and non-functional requirements
- bakendlogic: Backend rationale and core concepts
- documentation: User, admin, and API reference guides
- deployment: Installation and release notes
- reports: Final report, future work, lessons learned, and metrics
- CONTRIBUTING.md: Contribution and coding guidelines
- LICENSE: Project license
- todo.md: Running backlog of work items

Each document is self-contained, but high-level onboarding is in the repository root `README.md`.
