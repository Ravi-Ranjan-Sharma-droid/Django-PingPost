### Pattern Library

This document showcases common UI patterns used in PingPost and points to a live style guide page for hands-on exploration.

#### Live style guide

- Visit `/styleguide/` in a running development server to see components rendered with the real `layout.html` and theme styles.

#### Components included

- Buttons: primary accent, outline accent, and danger variants
- Cards: tweet card and auth card
- Forms: input fields, form actions, composer-like form
- Typography: headings, paragraph, links, muted text
- Utilities: shadows, rounded pill buttons

#### Screenshots (suggested)

- Capture images from `/styleguide/` and store under `project_docs/docs/design/ui-ux/screenshots/` (optional) for static documentation.

#### Usage guidance

- Use accent buttons for primary actions; outline for secondary.
- Use `.pp-card` for containers that need elevation; prefer consistent radius and shadow.
- Ensure focus states remain visible; do not remove outlines.
